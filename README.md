# Regression of Life Expectancy (1923‚Äì2023)

This project analyzes how life expectancy across countries has changed over the last century.  
Using **R**, I performed exploratory data analysis, built a **simple linear regression model**, and evaluated its ability to predict 2023 life expectancy from 1923 data.

---

## üß† Objective
To model and interpret the relationship between life expectancy in **1923** and **2023**,  
and to explore what historical factors might explain modern longevity patterns.

---

## üìä Data
The dataset includes global life expectancy values for 1923 and 2023 by country.  
Missing 2023 values were predicted using the regression model.

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| country | Country name |
| life1923 | Life expectancy in 1923 |
| life2023 | Life expectancy in 2023 |

## üß© Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Histograms of 1923 and 2023 life expectancies
   - Identification of outliers and historical context (e.g., war, epidemics)

2. **Linear Regression Model**
   - Model: `life2023 = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ * life1923 + Œµ`
   - Evaluated model significance (p-values, ANOVA)
   - Calculated **correlation**, **R¬≤**, and **residual diagnostics**

3. **Prediction**
   - Predicted 2023 life expectancy for countries missing modern data
   - Used confidence and prediction intervals for interpretation

4. **Residual Analysis**
   - Histogram and scatterplot of residuals
   - Normality test (Shapiro-Wilk)
   - Discussion of model adequacy and potential nonlinear effects

## üìà Key Results

- **Positive correlation** between life expectancy in 1923 and 2023 (~0.45 in sample)
- Each additional year in 1923 life expectancy corresponds to **~0.7 years higher** in 2023
- The linear model explains **‚âà30%** of the total variability (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.30)
- Residuals are approximately random and normally distributed
- Global life expectancy increased dramatically (~30‚Äì40 years average gain)

## üß† Interpretation
The model highlights how early 20th-century public health conditions were modest predictors of modern longevity, suggesting that social, economic, and medical developments since 1923 played a substantial role in extending life expectancy.
